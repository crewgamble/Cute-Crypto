We wanted to bring our pastels, J-fashion, and other cuteness to the Ethereum blockchain. Our first collection is a pass that will give exclusive access to all our future projects and also functions as a full scale art project. The collection consists of 8,888 hand-drawn randomly generated Cuties. The Cuties are composed of 200 possible traits across eight different properties at launch. We canâ€™t wait for you to join us and show off your cuteness in the Metaverse.</Subtitle>
